  #+begin_src shell
go get -u https://github.com/fedeztk/got
  #+end_src

- run it:
#+begin_src shell
got
#+end_src

* Testing
Development is done through =docker=, build the container with:
#+begin_src shell
docker build -t got .
#+end_src

Check that the build went fine:
#+begin_src shell
docker images | grep got

#+begin_src shell
docker run -it -e "TERM=xterm-256color" got
#+end_src

You are done!
